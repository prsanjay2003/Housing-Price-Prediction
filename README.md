## **Step 1: Project Overview**
The **House Price Prediction System** is a machine learning project that uses Python to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities.

## **Step 2: Installation & Setup**
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   - Download or clone the project from GitHub using:  
     ```
     git clone <your-repo-url>
     ```
   - Navigate to the project folder:  
     ```
     cd house-price-prediction
     ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**  
   - Create a virtual environment:  
     ```
     python -m venv env
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:  
     - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`  
     - Mac/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`

3. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   - Install dependencies using:  
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## **Step 3: Dataset Preparation**
1. **Download Dataset**  
   - Ensure the dataset (`house_prices.csv` or similar) is placed in the `data/` directory.
2. **Load Data in Jupyter Notebook**  
   - Open the notebook:  
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Run the first cell to load and preview the dataset.

## **Step 4: Model Development**
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Normalize numerical features  

2. **Train Model**  
   - Choose a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  
   - Fit the model using training data  

3. **Evaluate Model**  
   - Check accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score  
   - Compare different algorithms  

---

## **Step 5: Running the Prediction System**
1. **Run Jupyter Notebook Cells**  
   - Execute all cells to preprocess data and train the model.
2. **Make Predictions**  
   - Input house features to predict price.

---

## **Step 6: Save & Deploy Model**
1. **Save Trained Model**  
   ```
   import joblib
   joblib.dump(model, "house_price_model.pkl")
   ```
2. **Deploy using Flask (if needed)**  
   - Create an API to expose predictions  
   - Run server using:  
     ```
     python app.py
     ```
